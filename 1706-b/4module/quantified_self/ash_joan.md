## Self Assessment Rubric

Please self assess with the rubric below. Provide additional information to explain why you feel your project displays the score you've given yourself in _each_ section.

### Specification Adherence

Application implements **all** functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect.

- Above Expectations
- _Meets Expectations_**
- Below Expectations

Some bugs persist, calorie sort on food and form clearing after creating new food.

### Documentation

Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application.

- Above Expectations
- _Meets Expectations_**
- Below Expectations

ReadME's were created for both frontend and backend.

### HTML/UI

The team put some effort into styling, and the application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.

- Above Expectations
- _Meets Expectations_**  
- Below Expectations

Joan did a great job in styling the app. We did have some instances where id's weren't kebab case but they were for the most part.

### Accessibility

Developer implements code to increase accessibility.

- Above Expectations
- _Meets Expectations_**
- Below Expectations

User can tab through some items. However, I'm sure more could've been implemented.

### JS syntax and Style

JavaScript code is logically divided into files. Developers can show examples of good coding practices and demonstrate OOP concepts, like DRY and separation of concerns. Developers pay attention to indentation and naming conventions. They also consistently utilize ES5 or ES6 syntax and jQuery when working with events.

- Above Expectations
- Meets Expectations
- _Below Expectations_** 

We have a mixture of ES5 and ES6 in our code base. However, we did make an effort to break out different functional components to different files/folders.

### Git Workflow

The team uses master for production, uses feature branches for small groups of cards, and has a pull request for each feature with good context and conversation. Developers that aren't on the team have commented on PRs.

- Above Expectations
- _Meets Expectations_**
- Below Expectations

We did communicate and tag Katelyn as a collaborator, and asked her to review a PR of ours. However, it would've been better for us to have done that a little earlier and not after we had the vast majority of our front end built out.

### Project Management

The team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized and to track progress. Team is documenting conclusions and timelines on relevant cards.

- _Above Expectations_**
- Meets Expectations
- Below Expectations

We used waffle.io as our project management tool and it was extremely helpful in organizing our user stories.

### Communication

The team consistently reaches out to their Technical Lead for feedback on code quality and technical issues. The team responds to their Technical Lead in a timely manner.

- Above Expectations
- Meets Expectations
- _Below Expectations_**

We did tag Katelyn in one of our PR's, but we should've done it earlier as well.
